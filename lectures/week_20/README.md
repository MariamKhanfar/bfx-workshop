Week 20: 16S analysis with DADA2 and DESeq in R

You will need either access to the compute and storage resources on RIS to start an interactive RStudio session or have a local version of RStudio. I will walk you through to get an interactive Rstudio session started.

The packages and script were validated with R 4.0.3, I cannot guarantee that they will run smoothly with other versions of R. If possible update your local R. The docker image we will use for the interactive session is based on R 4.0.3.
