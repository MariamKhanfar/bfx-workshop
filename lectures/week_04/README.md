## Week 4: DNA Alignment Fundamentals

This week, we cover some basics of how sequence is generated, delve into the details of data and formats, and talk through basic QC of your sequence.

- [Lecture Recording - TBD]()

## Homework Assignment

Let's play around with some real sequence data and align it.  See the lecture for some commands that may help, and ask for help in #bfx_workshop if you get stuck!

1) Index the normal.bam file. HINT: samtools index OR igvtools

2) View the indexed normal.bam file with IGV HINT: Search for BRCA1.

3) Make a list of questions and/or observations about the alignments to discuss next week.

4) Are there other post-alignment processing steps we've missed? Bring suggestions for next week.
