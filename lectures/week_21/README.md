## Homework Assignments

This homework builds on what we learned last week. To complete the homework assignment you will need to have R/Rstudio installed. You will not be able to open the Rmarkdown homeowrk file without this installation. In addition, we recommend installation of the following packages within R/Rstudio to do the homework for week 20 and week 21. (note: RStudio may prompt you to install these when you open the Rmarkdown file) 
- Seurat
- RMarkdown
- ggplot2
- cowplot
- dplyr
- Matrix
- viridis
- NEW for day 2: harmony
- NEW for day 2: SeuratWrappers

To run the day 2 [Rmarkdown homework file](BFXworkshop_2023scRNA_Day2.Rmd), the dataset listed in the .Rmd will need to be downloaded and both datasets will need to be in a file structure that is exactly as shown in the "ViewofHomeworkDirectories" photo below. The new dataset to download for this week's homework is linked in the .Rmd file and is starred in the screenshot entitled "DatasettoDownloadScreenshot" below. The R packages "harmony" and "SeuratWrappers" will be needed for this week's homework as well.
