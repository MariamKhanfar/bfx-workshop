# Bioinformatics (BFX) Workshop

Welcome to the Fall 2020 and Spring 2021 Bioinformatics (BFX) Workshop. 

# Schedule

Weekly Workshops on Mondays @ 10am

For the Fall 2020 Semester, all BFX Workshops will be held remotely via Zoom. Please see the Communications section below for accessing the Email alias to receive a Outlook Calendar invite that includes the Zoom meeting link. It's important to use the Outlook Calendar invite to be automatically notified of cancellations or changes to scheduling.

A tentative BFX Workshop schedule is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NEgi0krhzKT9TNxWx7aLcYhiQekeRxPR2NN5l-sxwfU/edit?usp=sharing).

# Participation

There are no requirements or qualifications to participate in the BFX Workshop. All we ask is that any willing participant visit our [Prerequisite](https://github.com/genome/bfx-workshop/blob/master/bfx_workshop_01_overview.ipynb) tutorial to understand the computer systems, tools, and languages that will be used throughout the course. Most of the languages and tools used are common to all fields and applications of Bioinformatics. No academic credits are earned for attending the course and there no attendance requirements.

# Organizers

This workshop is a collaborative effort between the McDonnell Genome Institute, Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology & Oncology, and Department of Pediatrics with faculty, staff, and student representation and participation from many other Institutes, Departments and Divisions at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.

The organizers and presenters of this workshop have multi-displinary backgrounds in Bioinformatics, Medicine, Computational Biology, Genetics, Computer Science, Oncology, Virology, Information Systems, Microbiology, Immunology, and many other combinations of both Data and Biological Sciences.

This team of organizers and presenters are committed to sharing best practice methods, technology, and knowledge from decades of experience working in these fields of study. New and novel applications of genome sequencing data are constantly evolving and even more so the analytical processes and tools used to translate data to information and knowledge are ever growing and changing. The team leading this workshop will focus on standard best practices while having an eye toward the future direction of each Bioinformatics topic.
