# Bioinformatics (BFX) Workshop

Welcome to the Fall 2020 and Spring 2021 Bioinformatics (BFX) Workshop! 

# Objectives

This workshop series is designed for people who want to:
1) learn the fundamentals of computational genomics
2) use this information to improve and expedite their research
3) expand their knowledge by hearing from experts in other subject areas

# Schedule

Weekly Workshops on Mondays @ 10am

For the Fall 2020 Semester, all BFX Workshops will be held remotely via Zoom. Please see the [Communications](https://github.com/genome/bfx-workshop/blob/master/README.md#communications) section below for accessing the Email alias to receive a Outlook Calendar invite that includes the Zoom meeting link. It's important to use the Outlook Calendar invite to be automatically notified of cancellations or changes to scheduling. 

The BFX Workshop schedule, subject to change, is available below:

As presenter dates are confirmed a full Fall 2020 and Spring 2021 academic calendar schedule will be made available. The first Monday of each month will be a short lecture (15-30m), followed by open "office hours" to get help with assignments, or ask for advice about your own projects. Probable topics include RNAseq, single-cell RNA, Microbial Genomics, Cancer Genomics, Population Genetics, Immunology, and more.


# Participation

There are no requirements or qualifications to participate in the BFX Workshop. All we ask is that any willing participant visit our [Prerequisite](https://github.com/genome/bfx-workshop/blob/master/bfx_workshop_01_overview.ipynb) tutorial to understand the computer systems, tools, and languages that will be used throughout the course. Most of the languages and tools used are common to all fields and applications of Bioinformatics. No academic credits are earned for attending the course and there no attendance requirements.  There will be "assignments" given during some lectures and we strongly encourage you to complete them in order to get the most out of the course - there is no substitute for hands-on learning!

# Organizers

This workshop is a collaborative effort between the McDonnell Genome Institute, Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology & Oncology, and Department of Pediatrics with faculty, staff, and student representation and participation from many other Institutes, Departments, and Divisions at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.

The organizers and presenters of this workshop have multi-disciplinary backgrounds in Bioinformatics, Medicine, Computational Biology, Genetics, Computer Science, Oncology, Virology, Information Systems, Microbiology, Immunology, and many other combinations of both Data and Biological Sciences.

This team of organizers and presenters are committed to sharing best practice methods, technology, and knowledge from decades of experience working in these fields of study. New and novel applications of genome sequencing data are constantly evolving and even more so the analytical processes and tools used to translate data to information and knowledge are ever growing and changing. The team leading this workshop will focus on standard best practices while having an eye toward the future direction of each Bioinformatics topic.
