## Homework Assignments

To complete the homework assignment you will need to have R/Rstudio installed. You will not be able to open the Rmarkdown homeowrk file without this installation. In addition, we recommend installation of the following packages within R/Rstudio (note: RStudio may prompt you to install these when you open the Rmarkdown file) 
- Seurat
- RMarkdown
- ggplot2
- cowplot
- dplyr
- Matrix
- viridis

In the [Rmarkdown homework file](https://wustl.box.com/s/05abd7g31220dclxipwq7dxkrd7kbnjz), play around with the different parameters. Variables to modify are in the top portion and described within the Rmarkdown. Once you set the analysis parameters, click 'Knit' in RStudio to run the code. It will take about 5 minutes to run.
