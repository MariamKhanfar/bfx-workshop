## Week 5: DNA Alignment Workflows

This week, we cover some basics of how sequence is generated, delve into the details of data and formats, and talk through basic QC of your sequence.

## Homework Assignment

Let's play around with some real sequence data and align it using a workflow definition language and a Workflow Execution Service (WES).  Please ask for help in #bfx_workshop if you get stuck!

1) Run the workflow using Cromwell on compute1/storage1

2) Identify a potential variant using IGV to visualize the alignments

3) Run multiqc to visualize the QC outputs of the alignment workflow
